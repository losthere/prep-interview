HashMap is a great advantage for us because it is so versatile and fits in a lot of use cases:

Want to load objects from an SQL result set and marshal them over the network? use a HashMap.
Want to group some log file content according to a certain field? HashMap is available.
Want to move some arbitrary data around without the restriction of creating a POJO or DTO? Oh! Hail! HashMap.
