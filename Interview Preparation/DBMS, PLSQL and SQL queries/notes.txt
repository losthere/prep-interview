Sequence is a feature supported by some database systems (oracle) to produce unique values on demand. 
Some DBMS like MySQL supports AUTO_INCREMENT in place of Sequence.

select hicn_no, row_number() over (partition by hicn_no order by hicn_no) from cms_mmr_restate;
select hicn_no, row_number() over (order by hicn_no) from cms_mmr_restate;

FOR VARCHAR2 - empty string('') is considered as null in Databases and when we miss any column in insert statement that means null (empty string).

DDL statement (create/alter/drop) does not work inside PL/SQL block as SQL engine is different than Oracle Engine
need to use excute immediate to run the same. example - execute immediate 'truncate table MSP_PBD_TEMP_INVESTIGATIONS ';

Clustered index can be 1 per table (primary key is always a clustered index) and non clustered index can be 255 per table.
Primary key is a clustered index and unique key has different index (better to have primary key instead of unique key)
One clustered index per table is allowed

Procedure can not return int and all but it can return cursor, function can return anything like int

A schema can be defined as the design of a database. The overall description of the database is called the database schema.
