longest increasing subsequence by DP (also print the one of the correct subsequence HINT - we need to figure out from back of the array) 
longest bi-tonic subsequence (sequence which first increases and then decreases)
longest common subsequence in 2 strings (also print the one of the largest common sub-sequence string)
maximum square having 1's in binary matrix
tiling Problem (count the number of ways to tile the "2 x n" board using the "2 x 1" tiles.
