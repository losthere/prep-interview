dfs ad bfs
detect cycle in directed graph (by dfs and using bool variable)
detect cycle in undirected graph 
topological ordering 
graph is bi partite or not (by dfs and bfs)
bellman ford O(V*E) [works for negative edges as well and no shortest path in case of negative cycles]
dijkstra by set - O(E * log(V)) and by priority queue - O(E * log(E)) [does not work for negative edges]
minimum spanning tree by kruskals
union find data structure
floyd warshall (all pairs shortest path problem)
single source shortest path in DAG using topological order O(E+V)
minimum Cost Path with Left, Right, Bottom and Up moves allowed in binary maze (dp is not applicable here)
find whether path exist (https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-whether-path-exist/0)

find strongly connected components in a graph using KosaRaju Algorithm
find minimum number of swaps required to sort the array
circle of strings
alien dictionary
snake and ladder problem
detect cycle in directed graph (how they implemented in geeks without using bool variable for returning from last recursion using dfs and you can go through other methods as well)
graph is bi partite or not (direct bool return in case of dfs)
