Heap tree-is a binary tree or 3-nary..or n-ary tree.It a an almost complete binary tree.Almost complete binary tree means leaves should be present in last and last but one level and leaves in the last level should be filled from left to right.

Two types - 1)max heap(root should be maximum  than the children and it should happen for every sub tree) 2) min heap
Note - Whatever is true for complete binary tree, is complete for almost complete binary tree as well.
			*	-----height 2  (Height of a node is the longest route from that node to any leaf)

		*----height 0
		Height of tree is height of the root
Maximum number of nodes in a tree = 2^(h+1) -1 
Height of a almost complete binary tree = floor(logn) where n is maximum number of nodes

In an almost complete binary tree what are the leaves' indexes.--floor(n/2)+1 to n where n is the number of nodes in the 


heap sort using max and min heap
Kth largest or smallest element using max and min heap (for continous stream as well)

merge K sorted array and linklist
nearly sorted array
